EPIMORPHISM - v1.0b

Epimorphism is a real time video feedback simultation that runs on Nvidia graphics hardware using CUDA.  Epimorphism recursively processes image data to create a continuous flow of higly virbant geometrical fractaline imagery.  The application can run autonomously or it can be manually controlled or scripted.

MODES:
Epimophsim has the following main methods of opperation:
  Autonomous  - The program can be completely automated and run with no user interaction
  Manual      - The parameters of the system can also be changed by the user, using various diffent control schemes
  Live        - This mode is a combination of the above two with a control scheme designed for triggering animations/effect with at particular rythms
  Video       - Scripts of automation events can be recorded/dynamically generated and then rendered ofline into high resolution videos 

CONTROLS:
see noumena/interface.txt

EXPLANATION:

This application simulates video feedback. On a high level, on each cycle, the following actions occur:

1. Grab the previously rendered frame
2. SEED: Draw something on top of it
3. TRANS: Put the image through a spatial transformation
4. COLOR: Put the image through a color transformation
5. Draw the result






CONFIGURATION 

Application - An object which contains one of each of the following:
Profile     - Contains CUDA & internal rendering configuration parameters.  Basically controls the fidelity of the images produced.
Context     - Configures the UI, both inputs & outputs.  Configures screen resolution, keyboard, mouse, and midi mappings, etc...
Environment - Configures miscelaneous application settings.
State       - Contains all information the CUDA engine needs to make a frame, and the specification for how this information evolves over time.x
