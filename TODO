Queue - 
  DONE - launch context  
  DONE - auto automating_components
  DONE - remove messages
  DONE - remove console
  DONE - detect resolutions, choose max
  DONE - SDL for cross platform resoltion detection
  DONE - remove logger output
  DONE - remove compiler output  
  DONE - remove midi  
  DONE - OpenCL  
  DONE - fix seg fault on exit - glTexSubImage2D in renderer - copying from pbo(HOW?)
  PARTIALLY DONE - replace pyopencl with custom ctypes
    DONE - main engine
    DONE - asynchronous keyboard commands

  Port:
    Sporadic crash on compile
    Asynchronous compiling
    Uploading images - problem & memory leak
    Downloading images
    Try texture instead of PBO
    better debug build program fail messages
    post processing
    print opencl info

  Video:
    optimize mencoder command
    render video

  Cross platform:
    remove pygame
    pyopengl bug?
    replace pyopencl with custom libraries

    OpenCL ATI Stream
    OpenCL Mac
    OpenCL CPUs - replace images with buffers

    windows binaries
    mac binaries
    linux binaries

  Optimization:
    investing gamma correction artifacts?
    move color axis to cpu
    optimize kernel
    scale performance to system

  Prepare for release:
    multiplebanannas@epimorphism.com
    transfer epimorphism.com dns
    contents & launch state
    periodically connect to server
    get rid of mouse
    introduction
    periodic craziness
    obfsucate


Later:	
  state nonsense
  move globals to config
  cleaning/documention pass

  Archiving

  plot fps

  cull mode - hsls & FRACT?
  reset_hsls

  finish states:
    paths
    scripts
    programs
    variables

    add image to state

    make sure they save correctly
    make sure they load correctly - startup & intermediate
    DONE? - multiple component switching

  don't route paths through cmd center.  all calls to animate_var through cmd_center

  stop paths dicts & programs in load

  make component switching a program

  unify scripts?


Documentation: 
  readme, etc
  add argument lists to help


Archiving - 
  MAYBE split state into sub states
  archive feature for adding to archive or deleting
  auto migrate feature


Contents:
  programs
  paths
  color function
  seed function
  transformations - state machine?
  seed transformations
  animations
  w=-1 response
  kernel optimization  
  scripts


Ideas -
  figure out command recording
  make components object
  move interface to another thread  
  metapaths 
  opengl effects
  better keyboard multipliers
  when loading state, upload image too?
  integrate ipython into console
  quantize angles?
  different reductions?
  camera input
  seed impulses
  deal with state dumps that occur while blending
  force fps
  multiple gpu integration
  Luv or Lab color space?

Misc Tasks - 
  color speeds & phases
  ??configmanager dump object newline issues(only really relevant for scripts & paths)
