  reimplement feedback buffer
  fix scripts
  update component/datamanager
  epimorphism working!!
  cleaned dict objs a bit
  smarter way of kernel substitutions
  reimplement cullmode
  move migrations to applications.py
  fix screenshot
  reimplement sphere mode
  reimplement post processing
  aux buffer & flush fb
  fix logging
  rotate saved images
  component interpolation cleaner
  launch context  
  auto automating_components
  remove messages
  remove console
  detect resolutions, choose max
  SDL for cross platform resoltion detection
  remove logger output
  remove compiler output  
  remove midi  
  OpenCL  
  fix seg fault on exit - glTexSubImage2D in renderer - copying from pbo(HOW?)
  pyopengl bug
  replace pyopencl with pycl
    main engine
    asynchronous keyboard commands
    post processing
    better debug build program fail messages    
    sporadic crash on compile
    understand ctypes/OpenCL/GIL/clCreateProgram issue
    uploading images - problem & memory leak
    fix automating components
    make kernel splices all use procompiler & #define?
    state.par now a dictionary
  added cmds dir

RELEASE QUEUE:

  TouchOSC template & osc work
  make osc use paths

  clean cmdcenter
  work on scripts - single or multiple?
  script, path & color phases?
  option to randomize seed
  load state
  record script


  time from 0 to 3
  time effect program

  implement pfn_notify in compiler
  do second stage compilation in componentmanager after first finished


  update pyopengl lib

  windows build
  mac build
    

  OpenCL ATI Stream??

  scale performance to system
  optimize kernel
    move color axis to cpu

  contents & launch state/app

  final testing & documentation

  website & videos



LATER:
  reorganize module(cmdcenter, engine, interface) initialization

  fix MIDI

  synchronize available pars to comonents
  clean globals
  think more about dict objs & structs file
  remove certain vars from dict_objs? - extension, path, type

  OpenCL CPUs - replace images with buffers
  fix console

  periodically connect to server ??
  more sophisticated application loading - switch apps on the fly
  figure out why app takes forever to exit - GLUT
  Try texture instead of PBO??? 

  investing gamma correction artifacts?

  Video:
    optimize mencoder command
    make another video

  Archiving

  plot fps

  cull mode - hsls & FRACT?
  reset_hsls

  finish states:
    paths
    scripts
    programs
    variables

    add image to state

    make sure they save correctly
    make sure they load correctly - startup & intermediate

  stop paths dicts & programs in load

  make component switching a program??


Documentation: 
  readme, etc
  add argument lists to help


Archiving - 
  archive feature for adding to archive or deleting
  auto migrate feature


Contents:
  programs
  paths
  color functions
  seed functions
  transformations - state machine?
  seed transformations
  animations
  w=-1 response
  kernel optimization  
  scripts


Ideas -
  figure out command recording
  make components object
  move interface to another thread  
  metapaths 
  opengl effects
  better keyboard multipliers
  when loading state, upload image too?
  integrate ipython into console
  quantize angles?
  different reductions?
  camera input
  seed impulses
  deal with state dumps that occur while blending
  force fps
  multiple gpu integration
  Luv or Lab color space?

Misc Tasks - 
  color speeds & phases
  ??configmanager dump object newline issues(only really relevant for scripts & paths)
