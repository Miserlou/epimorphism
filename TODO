  final preparations:
    cleaning/documention pass
    configure keyboard
    console  
    installer script/pyport midi

  contents:
    make cool things

  archiving:

  states:
    scripts
    paths
    programs
    variables

    add image to state

    make sure they save correctly
    make sure they load correctly - startup & intermediate

  don't route paths through cmd center.  all calls to animate_var through cmd_center

  stop paths dicts & programs in load

  make component switching a program

  unify scripts?

  better keyboard multipliers
  when loading state, upload image too?
  integrate ipython into console
  post processing multiple gpu
  quantize angles?
  different reductions?
  camera input
  seed impulses
  deal with state dumps that occur while blending
  force fps


Misc Tasks -
