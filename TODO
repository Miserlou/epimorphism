  render video

  optimize kernel
  OpenCL Bugs

  periodically connect to server

  scale performance to system

  OpenCL ATI Stream
  OpenCL Mac
  OpenCL CPUs - replace images with buffers

  Final Tasks

  keyboard
  console

  optimize packages
  cross platform
  windows binaries
  mac binaries
  linux binaries

  introduction
  periodic craziness

  get rid of mouse

  obfuscate

  contents & launch state


OpenCL Bugs:
  fix rotate_hsls bug
  fix cull mode
  async kernel compilation
  fix seg fault on exit - glTexSubImage2D in renderer - copying from pbo


Final Tasks:
  move globals to config


Later:	
  cleaning/documention pass

  Archiving

  fix video scripts

  finish states:
    paths
    scripts
    programs
    variables

    add image to state

    make sure they save correctly
    make sure they load correctly - startup & intermediate

  don't route paths through cmd center.  all calls to animate_var through cmd_center

  stop paths dicts & programs in load

  make component switching a program

  unify scripts?


Documentation: 
  readme, etc
  add argument lists to help


Archiving - 
  MAYBE split state into sub states
  archive feature for adding to archive or deleting
  auto migrate feature?


Contents:
  programs
  paths
  color function
  seed function
  transformations - state machine?
  seed transformations
  animations
  w=-1 response
  kernel optimization  
  scripts


Ideas -
  figure out command recording
  make components object
  move interface to another thread  
  metapaths 
  opengl effects
  better keyboard multipliers
  when loading state, upload image too?
  integrate ipython into console
  post processing multiple gpu
  quantize angles?
  different reductions?
  camera input
  seed impulses
  deal with state dumps that occur while blending
  force fps


Misc Tasks - 
  save image fps_time


Bugs - 
  color speeds & phases
  video rendering script bug     
  ??configmanager dump object newline issues(only really relevant for scripts & paths)
  ??fix console window
